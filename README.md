# Features 
                  
# 1. Admin Controls
The admin has their own login to manage everything, like changing ticket prices, updating the concert date, and even editing the artist performing,
They can view all tickets, delete specific ones, or clear all bookings if needed.

# 2. Easy Ticket Booking
Users can book tickets with a unique seat and ticket number, The system also handles payments and gives change if needed.

# 3. Flexible Updates
Ticket prices, concert dates, the name of the concert, and the performing artist’s name can all be updated in real-time by the admin.

# 4. Simple Cancellation and Usage
Users can cancel a ticket, make it available for others, or mark it as "used" once it’s been scanned or redeemed.

# 5. Clear Interface
Both the admin and user interfaces are straightforward, making it easy to navigate and understand.

# 6. Real-Time Ticket Management
Booked and used tickets are tracked separately, ensuring accurate data management for both users and the admin.

# Limitations

# 1. No Data Storage
Since the system doesn’t save data permanently, everything resets when you close the program.

# 2. Basic Security
The admin password is hardcoded in the program, which isn’t very secure if someone gets access to the source code.

# 3. No Online Payments
Payments are simulated, so there’s no integration with actual payment methods like credit cards or e-wallets.

# 4. Command-Line Only
It runs in the terminal, which might not be as user-friendly as a graphical app for some people.

# 5. Single-User Sessions
It’s designed for one admin or user at a time, so it’s not ideal for high-traffic use.

# 6. Basic Error Handling
The system could use more checks for invalid inputs, like incorrect dates or seat numbers outside the range.
